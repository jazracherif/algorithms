# Algorithms
Python implementation of a number of algorithms, some of which (but not all) are homeworks taken from the [Coursera Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) by Tim Roughgarden at Stanford. 

Here's a list from the coursera class:
+ **Karatsuba**: a faster algorithm for multiplication
+ **Inversion**: Find the number of inversions in an array: uses mergesort as a basis
+ **quicksort**: an implementation of quicksort
+ **MinCut**: an algorithm that operates on a graph to calculate the minimun number of edges that can divide the graph in 2.
+ **SCC**: Find the Strongly Connected Components in a directed graph using Breadth Depth Search
+ **djikstra**: Djikstra's Shortest Path Algorithm
+ **prim**: The PRIM Minimim Spanning Tree algorithm
+ **schedule**: A Greedy algorithm for a scheduling task given weight and completion times for a series of jobs
+ **median-maintenance**: median-maintenance algorithm using a min-heap and a max-heap
+ **2-sum**: 2-sum algorithm where the value is in a range
+ **clustering**: Max-spacing clustering algorithms using kruskal's algorithm with a Union-Find data structure
+ **huffman**: The Huffman variable encoding algorithmalgorithm
+ **mwis**: The Maximum Weighted Independent Set Algorithm using Dynamic Programming

Other Algorithms and routines:
+ **Bit Manipulation**: some routines for manipulating bits
+ **Counting**: An algorithm to find two values in an array that sum up to a desired value
+ **itoa**: algorithms for both atoi() and itoa()
+ **reverse**: algorithm to reverse a number, considering overflow
+ **Container**: Find the Container With Most Water given a list of values corresponding to container edges.
+ **fastpath**: A Dynamic Programming Algorithm to find the fastest path in an array where each index value consists of allowed look-ahead steps
