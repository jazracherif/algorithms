# Algorithms
Python implementation of a number of algorithms, any of which (but not all) are homeworks taken from the [Coursera Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) by Tim Roughgarden at Stanford. 

Here's a list:
+ **Inversion**: Find the number of inversions in an array: uses mergesort as a basis
+ **Karatsuba**: a faster algorithm for multiplication
+ **quicksort**: an implementation of quicksort 
+ **MinCut**: an algorithm that operates on a graph to calculate the minumun number of edges that can divide the graph in 2.
+ **Counting**: An algorithm to find two values in an array that sum up to a desired value
+ **Bit Manipulation**: some routines for manipulating bits
+ **SCC**: The Strongly Connected Component algorithm
+ **itoa**: algorithms for both atoi() and itoa()
+ **reverse**: algorithm to reverse a number, considering overflow
